# BiblioStats #

## What is BiblioStats? ##
  > A minimal, easy-to-use, personal reading tracking app. Keep track of what books you've read, what you're currently reading, what you'd like to read in the future, and what books you simply did not finish.

## Why use BiblioStats? ##
  > BiblioStats is for readers who simply want to track their reading without sifting through countless features they don't use, such as social media, publishing news, or endless notifications.

## Summary ##
  > BiblioStats allows users to search for books, add them to their bookshelf, and keep track of the status (currently reading, read, to be read, did not finish). Additionally, they can track when they started reading a book, when they finished reading it, how they rated it, their review of it, and any other notes or thoughts on it. Users can also see their overall stats as well as yearly stats, including how many books were read, how many total pages were read, and the average rating.

## Problem ##
  > Other book tracker sites are complex and hard to use due to countless features some may not use.

## Solution ##
  > BiblioStats' simplicity makes it easy for users to quickly track their reading without having to spend time just looking for what they want.
